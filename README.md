# SCADA Solar Performance KPI & Data Quality Monitoring Tool using Python

## Overview
This project analyzes solar PV plant SCADA time-series data to monitor performance and automate data quality validation. It computes key KPIs and detects anomalies to support solar asset performance engineering workflows.

---

## Objectives
- Compute solar performance KPIs (Daily Yield, CUF)
- Monitor inverter power trends
- Detect SCADA data quality issues
- Identify abnormal performance patterns

---

## Dataset
Solar Power Generation Data (Plant 1)  
Includes inverter AC/DC power, timestamp, and yield metrics.
